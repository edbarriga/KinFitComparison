This code is an upgrade/update from Alex Barnes code ([presentation](https://halldweb.jlab.org/DocDB/0035/003585/001/Barnes-ChiSq-Update-2018-04-11.pdf)/[GitHub](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_recon/tree/master/src/programs/Utilities/mergeTrees)). The goal is to answer the question is my event more likely to be x or y? where x and y have the same final state. But also, I want to expand it to see if we can match x with z where z has an extra photon or two. This last one would be useful since a lot of analyses seem to have a missing pi0 that could be hiding in the unused showers
